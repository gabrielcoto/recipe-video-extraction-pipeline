# Two image modes via BUILD_MODE build arg:
#   --build-arg BUILD_MODE=slim   (default) base only: /health + tests; no ML models
#   --build-arg BUILD_MODE=full   installs requirements-ml.txt too: real STT/OCR/LLM/yt-dlp
#
# Slim image:   ~250 MB, builds in ~30 s. Use for CI, contract checks, dev sandbox.
# Full image:   ~5-6 GB, builds in ~15-20 min. Pre-downloads Whisper + both PaddleOCR
#               (ru + en) models so every container start is instant. Use for real extraction.
#
# BASE IMAGE NOTE: Debian Bookworm (12) is the current stable release with full
# security support (EOL: ~2026-06 for the main suite, ~2028 for LTS).
# Earlier versions of this Dockerfile used Bullseye to dodge a PaddlePaddle 2.6.x
# zlib segfault (inflateReset2). That issue is fixed in PaddlePaddle 3.x (see
# requirements-ml.txt), so we now ship on the current Debian — no archive mirror
# hacks, no EOL package 404s.

ARG BUILD_MODE=slim
ARG WHISPER_MODEL=small
# Space-separated list of faster-whisper models baked into the image. WHISPER_MODEL
# (above) is only the runtime default; any model in this list can be selected via
# .env (WHISPER_MODEL=medium) with no download at the first request. Default
# "small" keeps the image as light as before; to bake medium as well (+~1.5 GB
# to the image, slower build), set "small medium" — without baking, a medium
# .env value downloads it once at the first request into the hf-cache volume.
ARG WHISPER_PRELOAD_MODELS="small"
# ENV propagates the build-arg into runtime: ARG alone is build-scoped, so
# without this line a container built with a non-default WHISPER_MODEL would
# run without the variable, fall back to the "small" default in src/config.py,
# and the baked model would sit unused while the first request downloads small
# (~460 MB). With ENV the runtime default matches what was baked; a value in
# .env still overrides. The compose full build pins the baked model to small
# (see docker-compose.full.yml); medium can be baked via
# --build-arg WHISPER_PRELOAD_MODELS="small medium". No effect in slim mode.
ENV WHISPER_MODEL=${WHISPER_MODEL}

# ffmpeg: media probing (ffprobe) + audio extraction + frame extraction (ffmpeg).
# libgl1 + libglib2.0-0: runtime deps of paddleocr / paddlepaddle.
# libgomp1, libblas3, liblapack3, zlib1g: PaddlePaddle runtime deps that the slim
# image doesn't include by default — installing them avoids runtime segfaults.

# nodejs MUST come from NodeSource (22.x), NOT from Debian Bookworm: yt-dlp
# (2026.10+) solves YouTube's player challenges in a JavaScript runtime and
# accepts node only >= 22.0.0 (MIN_SUPPORTED_VERSION in yt_dlp's
# utils/_jsruntime.py; deno >= 2.3 / bun >= 1.2.11 are the alternatives).
# Debian Bookworm's nodejs package is 18.x, which yt-dlp reports as
# unsupported — POST /extract then fails with download_failed and
# "No supported JavaScript runtime could be found". The runtime name is
# configurable at runtime via YTDLP_JS_RUNTIME (src/config.py).
